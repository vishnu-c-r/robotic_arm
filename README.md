# Arduino Nano Robotics Arm Control

This Arduino project demonstrates how to control a robotic arm using an Arduino Nano. The code allows you to control the position of the arm's servos using potentiometers. By adjusting the potentiometers, you can control the movement of the robotic arm.

## Components Required

- Arduino Nano board
- Robotic arm kit (including servos)
- Four potentiometers
- Jumper wires

## Installation

1. Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
2. Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) if you haven't already.
3. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
4. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to **File -> Open**. Browse to the location where you saved the repository and open the Arduino code file (`robotic_arm_control.ino`).
5. Connect your Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
6. Select the appropriate board and port from the **Tools** menu in the Arduino IDE.
7. Click the **Upload** button to upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

## Usage

1. Power up your Arduino Nano.
2. Adjust the potentiometers to control the position of the robotic arm's servos.
3. Observe how the movement of the potentiometers corresponds to the movement of the robotic arm.
4. Experiment with different potentiometer positions to control the arm's movement in various ways.

## Customization

- If your robotic arm has more or fewer servos, modify the `numServos` constant in the Arduino code accordingly.
- Adjust the servo pin assignments (`servoPins`) and potentiometer pin assignments (`potPins`) to match your actual wiring.
- Modify the servo angle ranges (`servoMinAngles` and `servoMaxAngles`) to suit your specific servo requirements.

## Troubleshooting

- Double-check your circuit connections to ensure they match the circuit diagram.
- Verify that you have selected the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
- Make sure the Arduino Nano is receiving power.
- Check the serial monitor for any error messages or unexpected behavior.
- If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue on this repository for assistance.
